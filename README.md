# disaster-tweet-nlp-classifier-kaggle
A Natural Language Processing project to classify tweets about real disasters using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression. Kaggle competition entry.
🧠 Disaster Tweet Classification with NLP (Kaggle Competition)
This project focuses on a real-world classification problem: determining whether a tweet is about a genuine disaster or not. The dataset comes from Kaggle’s “NLP with Disaster Tweets” competition. I approached this as an end-to-end machine learning task using industry-relevant tools and techniques.

Key Highlights:

🔍 Text Cleaning: Removed noise from tweet data (mentions, links, hashtags, stopwords, etc.)

🧾 TF-IDF Vectorization: Converted cleaned text into numerical vectors for model input.

🤖 Modeling: Used Logistic Regression as a baseline classifier with high interpretability and speed.

📈 Evaluation: Split training data for validation to assess model performance before testing.

📤 Submission Ready: Predictions generated and formatted for Kaggle submission.

Why this project matters:

It simulates a real-world scenario where social media data needs to be mined for crisis response.

Shows practical NLP techniques useful in industry roles.

Demonstrates not just coding, but problem-solving, pipeline design, and result interpretation.

This project is part of my data science portfolio as I build toward a role in data analysis and NLP-focused projects. I'm continuously improving it by exploring feature engineering, model tuning, and deep learning techniques.
